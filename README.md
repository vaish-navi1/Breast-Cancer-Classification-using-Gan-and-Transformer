To develop a stain normalization approach based on GAN to cope with stain heterogeneity while retaining tissue morphology. And build a tissue graph representing both the spatial connectivity and  structural patterns of tissue regions. To establish a graph transformer, to utilize self-attention mechanisms to enable feature extraction and accurate breast cancer classification. 

The outcome of the project is it successfully removes stain variations across histopathology datasets by using GAN-based stain normalization. Another outcome of the project is that our proposed model is expected to enhance 
classification accuracy for various breast cancer subtypes. 

For this, I used benchmark datasets CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K.

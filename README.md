To develop a stain normalization approach based on GAN to cope with stain heterogeneity while retaining tissue morphology. To build a tissue graph that represents both the spatial connectivity and  structural 
patterns of tissue regions. To establish a graph transformer, to utilize self-attention mechanisms to enable feature extraction, and accurate breast cancer classification. 
The outcome of the project is it successfully remove stain variations across histopathology datasets by using GAN-based stain normalization. Another outcome of the project is that our proposed model is expected to enhance 
classification accuracy for various breast cancer subtypes.
